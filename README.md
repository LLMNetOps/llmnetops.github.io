## About

LLMNetOps is an ISIF Asia 2025 project by Universitas Brawijaya aimed at addressing the AI-literacy gap among network operations professionals in IDREN (Indonesia Research and Education Network) member institutions.

Many IDREN member institutions struggle to adopt AI-supported network management due to limited staff, uneven expertise, and reliance on undocumented knowledge. Generative AI offers potential for improving documentation and troubleshooting, but most administrators lack training, confidence, and tools that respect data privacy—creating an AI-literacy gap.

## Project Goals

- **Privacy-First AI Adoption** - Promote locally-hosted open-source LLM models as practical solutions for institutions concerned about data privacy and institutional autonomy
- **Contextual AI for Infrastructure** - Introduce generative AI specifically to support technical teams in managing, understanding, and documenting their own infrastructure
- **Bridging the AI Literacy Gap** - Empower network and IT staff with the knowledge and confidence to use AI in their daily tasks
- **Knowledge-Sharing Community** - Build a culture of learning and shared problem-solving through workshops and peer collaboration
- **Secure LLM Integration** - Investigate how locally-hosted LLMs can be safely integrated into network operations while ensuring security of sensitive data
- **Tailored Solutions** - Empower IDREN members to confidently assess and adopt AI solutions that align with their specific requirements
